Password Strength Evaluation Report
Objective

To create a strong password, evaluate its strength using online password strength testing tools, and understand the factors that contribute to password security.

Password Tested

(w0RkH@rD//)

Tool Used

Online password strength checker (example: passwordmeter.com or similar free password testing sites).

Results

Password Length: 12 characters

Character Variety:

Lowercase letters ✅

Uppercase letters ✅

Numbers ✅

Symbols ✅

Strength Rating: Very Strong

Estimated Time to Crack: ~450 years

Review Message from Tool:

"Fantastic, using that password makes you as secure as Fort Knox."

Analysis

Length:
At 12 characters, the password exceeds the minimum recommended length (8–10). Longer passwords are exponentially harder to brute force.

Complexity:
Includes all four character classes (upper, lower, digits, symbols), increasing entropy.

Pattern Avoidance:
The password does not contain dictionary words or predictable keyboard patterns, reducing vulnerability to dictionary or pattern-based attacks.

Estimated Strength:
With an estimated crack time of 450 years, this password is considered very strong against brute-force attacks with current computational power.

Recommendations

This password is very strong and demonstrates best practices.

For even higher security:

Use 14–16+ characters when possible.

Ensure uniqueness (avoid reusing this password across multiple accounts).

Consider a passphrase for memorability (e.g., random words with symbols).

Store securely in a password manager.

Regularly test against breach databases (e.g., Have I Been Pwned) to ensure it has not appeared in leaked datasets.

Conclusion

The tested password (w0RkH@rD//) meets strong password criteria and is highly resistant to brute force or guessing attacks. It serves as an example of how length, complexity, and randomness contribute to password security.
